Sequence data processing was performed on a FreeBSD 12.1 HPC cluster running
the SLURM workload manager.

Differential analysis was performed on a FreeBSD 12.1 workstation using
DESeq2 1.28.1 under R 4.0.1.

The pipeline is available at https://github.com/auerlab/CNC-EMDiff.

Trimming was performed using cutadapt 2.7 under Python 3.6 with the following
parameters:
    -u -3 -U -3
	Trim last 3 bases from each read
    -u +15 -U +15
	Trim first 15 bases from each read
	We noticed a strong unexplained bias in these early reads
    -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT
	Adapters were trimmed by the sequencing center, but some trailing
	adapter contamination remained in short reads
    --minimum-length=20
	Discard reads with fewer than 20 bases after trimming

Quality was checked using fastqc 0.11.8 with no special parameters.
Combined reports were generated using multiqc 1.8.

Alignments were performed using bwa 0.7.17.
The reference genome was generated by concatenating the autosomal files
Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.chromosome.1.fa.gz through
Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.chromosome.19.fa.gz from
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-$release/fasta/mus_musculus/dna

bwa index Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.autosomes.fa
srun bwa mem -M reference file-R1.fastq file-R2.fastq > outfile.sam
    -M flag shorter split hits as secondary for tools that do not support
    split alignments
    R1 and R2 represent separate paired-end reads

SAM files were quality checked with fastqc and multiqc
