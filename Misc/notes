    how to differentiate to chondrocytes or peripheral neurons
    what's expressed in intermediate progenitor cells?
    flow cytometry
    day 4 and 14
	rnaseq atacseq
    3 biological replicates

Exclude X chromosome

CE1,2,3... bioreps
A,B,C... time points
A = day 0
B = day 4 C, 2 N
C = day 14, 6 N
R1,2 = paired end
S# = sample
C = chrondrocyte
N = neural

trimgalore autosense adapters?
spreadsheet with adapters?
read length - see html file
4^30 sufficient for mapping
--trim2 or 3 for added safety
file sizes?
fastqc just on trimmed
kallisto - build reference transcriptome using what?
	   or does it already exist?

Diff analysis
    Sleuth (works with kallisto output)
    Compares day x vs control
    Expect thousands of genes
    hierarchical clustering
    visualize with R
