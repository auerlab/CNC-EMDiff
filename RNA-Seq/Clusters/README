These spreadsheets contain results from the Sleuth DE R script augmented
manually with cluster information taken from the plot R script.

Excel will likely corrupt some of your gene names when importing Sleuth
data if it thinks they are dates (e.g. March4).  There is no way to disable
this "feature".  You can preformat the column as "text" to disable formatting
for that spreadsheet.

I do not know whether LibreOffice does the same.

TSVs generated by:

LibreOffice -> Save as CSV -> tr ',' '\t' < file.csv > file.tsv
