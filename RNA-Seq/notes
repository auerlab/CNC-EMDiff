GTF may include non-coding RNA
cDNA should be limited to mRNA
shorter min, multimap->thrown out

Abundances:

total xscripts est-counts min 10, probably higher
estimating proportion of total mapped reads - sum of est_counts / total reads
tpm depends on total reads in lib

sleuth/deseq2
normalization (total reads, etc)
pathway analysis/clustering of de xscripts by tpm z-scores
positive controls - 10 for each comparison
go enrichment
mgi page?
    list of genes, geo analysis

find out paired reads map vs individual reads
est avg fragment length
    ability to detect splicing (isoforms)
Total read counts look OK per Ava

How many reads mapped?  

Non-zero tpms?
