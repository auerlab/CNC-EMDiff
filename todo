Filter # peaks

Renumber scripts and output dirs in chronological order
    1 = first
    2a, 2b = second, can run at the same time

What reference genome is best?
    From Ensembl README:
    dna = unmasked
    dna_rm = repeat masked = repeats replaced with 'N' (RepeatMasker tool)
    dna_sm = soft-masked = repeats denoted with lower case bases

    toplevel
    primary_assembly - like toplevel minus haplotypes and patches
    chromosome files same as toplevel?
    * Used autosomal chromosome files and concatenated for first run

Merged BAMs
    Are we using these for anything besides IGV?

Merging overlapping peaks?
    Should we merge peaks from replicates at the same time point?
    bedtools does not directly support minimum overlap
	It does support maximum separation
	May be a reason for this
